A notable example was the Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi 2019, where Finland sent a delegation of athletes to participate in the UAE’s landmark hosting of this inclusive sporting event. The Finnish community in the UAE actively supported the games – the Finnish Business Council in Dubai even sponsored Finland’s special needs athletes and organized a family day during the competition. This joint engagement in the Year of Tolerance (2019) highlighted both countries’ commitment to empowering youth of determination through sport. Another illustration of collaboration is in global youth forums: in 2023, young leaders from Finland and the UAE convened in Helsinki under the Helsinki Policy Forum to discuss youth perspectives on climate and peace. This meeting brought together youth from Europe and the Middle East, including Emirati and Finnish representatives, to share ideas on involving young people in policy-making. Such initiatives underscore how youth from both nations have found common ground in addressing global challenges, reflecting a spirit of youth diplomacy alongside sports diplomacy. "

            "title": "Alignment and Potential Friction Points",
            "content": "Overall, Finland and the UAE are aligned in viewing youth engagement and sports as vital to their nations’ futures, even if their methods differ due to cultural and historical context. Both countries see young people as agents of positive change and sports as a unifying force that builds community and leadership skills. This common ground has made cooperation relatively friction-free and often enthusiastic. Importantly, both governments champion inclusivity – Finland with its legislated youth inclusion and sports-for-all ethos, and the UAE with high-profile empowerment of youth and promotion of sports among women, men, and people of determination. Potential differences in approach are handled as opportunities for exchange rather than points of conflict. For example, Finland’s tradition of youth autonomy and volunteer-driven sports clubs might contrast with the UAE’s government-driven programs; however, exchanges might be a possibilitiy where Finnish experts advise on community sports programming in the Emirates, while Emirati officials share how strong government backing can rapidly upscale initiatives. Culturally, respect is maintained: Finnish partners are mindful of the UAE’s cultural norms (such as gender considerations in sports or the role of family in youth decisions) and the UAE appreciates Finland’s non-intrusive, collaborative style. Friction points are minimal. For instance, discussions may arise on balancing competitive sports with academic commitments or on approaches to youth civic activism, but these are navigated with mutual respect and a focus on outcomes that benefit young people in both societies."
          },
          {
            "title": "Partnerships Between Institutions and Programs",
            "content": "Beyond events, there have been growing partnerships at the institutional level focusing on youth and sports. In 2021, Finland and the UAE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen cooperation across education, culture, youth, and sports agreement provides a framework for exchange programs and knowledge-sharing – for instance, facilitating dialogue between the UAE’s Ministry of Culture and Youth and Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture. Educational institutions have also built bridges: Finland’s expertise in holistic education and physical activity has attracted interest in the UAE’s school sector. Finnish early education models – which emphasize play and physical well-being – have been introduced in Emirati early learning centers through partnerships with Finnish organizations. On the sports front, collaboration is often informal but impactful. Sports academies and federations from both countries have exchanged best practices; for example, Finnish coaches and sports tech firms have lent expertise to training programs in the UAE, while Emirati sports authorities have participated in international seminars hosted in Finland. Even at the highest diplomatic levels, sports serve as a friendly linkage – Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö famously took time during a state visit to go rollerblading on Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina Circuit, symbolically adding the UAE to the list of countries in which he has skated. This light-hearted “diplomacy on wheels” exemplified the mutual goodwill and cultural exchange fostered through a shared love of sports."

He expressed gratitude for the UAE’s participation in his inauguration ceremony and conveyed well-wishes to the UAE leadership, underlining his intent to further develop Finland–UAE relations. This early diplomatic exchange underscores the value he places on UAE-Finland ties. In his foreign policy agenda, President Stubb has noted that global challenges “cannot be solved only with those who share the same views”, suggesting openness to collaboration with diverse partners beyond Europe. Notably, even before his presidency, Alexander Stubb engaged with UAE-led global initiatives. He was a founding member of the World Happiness Council – a high-level international panel convened in Dubai to promote global well-being – reflecting a shared interest with the UAE in innovative approaches to governance and quality of life. In early 2013, Alexander Stubb (then Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade) visited the UAE on an official trade mission. Stubb led about 50 Finnish companies to the UAE to promote Finland’s world-class education system and boost economic ties. Many of these companies were in the education sector, reflecting Finland’s aim to showcase its top-tier educational expertise on an equal, accessible basis. During the visit, Stubb (alongside Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen) met with UAE’s Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and several other ministers (covering foreign affairs, economy, education, energy, etc.). These talks focused on expanding bilateral cooperation in trade and education, as well as discussing regional issues of mutual interest. This high-level engagement underscored the mission’s goal of strengthening diplomatic and economic relationships."

    "title": "Finland’s Approach to UAE Relations under Stubb’s Leadership",
    "content": "Under President Stubb, the Finnish government’s approach to the UAE is characterised by proactive engagement and a focus on practical cooperation. Finland recognises the UAE as a significant geopolitical and economic player in the Gulf, and under Stubb’s guidance it seeks to deepen ties across government ministries and industries. In early 2025, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo (working in tandem with President Stubb’s foreign policy goals) noted that the UAE is Finland’s largest export destination in the Middle East, with bilateral trade growing considerably in recent years. High-level visits have been leveraged to strengthen these relations. For example, Prime Minister Orpo’s visit to Abu Dhabi in January 2025, aimed to elevate political dialogue and showcase Finland as an innovative, reliable partner in sustainable development and technology. The visit was timed with the 50th anniversary of UAE-Finnish diplomatic relations and featured a business delegation organised by Business Finland. This reflects Finland’s “Team Finland” approach, integrating governmental and private sector efforts to promote trade and investment. President Stubb encourages such initiatives, seeing economic diplomacy as a cornerstone of the relationship. Finnish ministries have been actively working with their Emirati counterparts: a Joint Committee between the UAE and Finland convenes to explore cooperation in sectors like trade, education, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, space, as well as transportation and logistics. In November 2024, the second meeting of this Joint Committee in Helsinki, co-chaired by senior officials from both sides, reaffirmed a commitment to forge new partnerships in these fields. Notably, the inauguration of a UAE–Finland Business Council was announced on that occasion, with both sides highlighting the flexibility and complementary strengths of their private sectors."

    "title": "Ares of Alignment and Potential Friction Points",
    "content": "Finland under President Stubb emerges as a complementary partner in many strategic areas. Both countries are medium-sized nations with global outlooks, valuing stability and development. Notably, the UAE’s long-term strategies – such as economic diversification away from oil, investment in innovation, renewable energy, and advanced technology – closely mirror core areas of Finnish expertise. This alignment is evident in joint work on clean energy and education: Finland’s cutting-edge solutions in renewable energy, digital education, and healthcare align with the UAE’s modernisation goals. Both nations also share an interest in addressing global challenges like climate change. Finland, a leader in climate action, finds common ground with the UAE’s initiatives in renewable energy (e.g. Masdar) and the UAE’s hosting of multilateral climate forums (such as COP28). There is likewise a mutual commitment to global peace and security. Finland and the UAE have both contributed to international peacekeeping (Finland in UN/EU missions, and the UAE in regional peace-support operations) and condemn extremism and terrorism. Their cooperation in forums like the United Nations has generally been constructive, focusing on dialogue and development. Economic and innovation partnership is a strong pillar of alignment. Finland’s high-tech and knowledge economy aligns with the UAE’s quest to be a knowledge-based economy, creating mutually advantageous opportunities in a range of areas from smart city solutions to 5G networks and artificial intelligence. Finland (in line with EU consensus) has taken stands on regional conflicts on humanitarian grounds; in 2018 it froze new arms export licences to countries involved in the Yemen war, including the UAE. While this policy was not directed at the UAE bilaterally, it highlights how Finland’s EU aligned decisions might occasionally restrain aspects of bilateral defence cooperation. President Stubb is an outspoken critic of Russia’s actions in Ukraine and firmly aligns with Western sanctions on Russia. The UAE, on the other hand, tends to maintain a more neutral and pragmatic stance, keeping channels open with Moscow even while supporting international law."

He was appointed by President (now President) Alexander Stubb in March 2024 as a member of the presidential cabinet, tasked with strengthening Finland’s conflict resolution initiatives. In this capacity, Brummer acts as a senior adviser to the President on international peace mediation efforts. He brings extensive field experience to the role, having spent over a decade at the CMI – Martti Ahtisaari Peace Foundation (Crisis Management Initiative) where he oversaw mediation projects across Africa, the Middle East, and Eurasia. As CMI’s Programme Director (2013–2024), he was responsible for planning and implementing the NGO’s conflict resolution, working on peace processes in areas such as Myanmar, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Ukraine, and Palestine. This civil society background equips Brummer with on-the-ground mediation expertise and a broad network of contacts in conflict regions."

    "title": "UAE-Related Statements and Policies",
    "content": "Finland’s official stance toward the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the context of peace mediation is characterised by respect and partnership. Both countries have affirmed a shared commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the importance of international cooperation in diplomacy. This was evident during the inaugural UAE–Finland Political Consultations in November 2022, where both sides emphasised their mutual dedication to resolving disputes through dialogue and the role of regional and international organisations in supporting peace. Such high-level statements set the tone for Brummer’s mandate to engage with the UAE: Finland views the UAE as a like-minded actor in championing diplomatic solutions to conflicts. In line with Finland’s foreign policy, Brummer’s work involves building on these shared principles. Finnish officials and analysts recognise that the UAE has become an increasingly active player in peace and mediation efforts, especially in the Middle East and Horn of Africa regions. In Finnish assessments of global mediation, the UAE’s mediation style is noted as “quiet and discreet,” an observation on Abu Dhabi’s low-profile facilitation style. This contrasts with some other mediators’ more public approaches, and Finland is aware that the UAE often works patiently and confidentially to bridge divides. While direct public statements from Brummer specifically about the UAE are not widely reported, the policies he advances imply respect for the UAE’s contributions. For instance, Finland’s foreign ministry has observed that Gulf States (including the UAE) see stability as vital and have vested interests in mediating conflicts to secure their economic and security goals."

    "title": "Role of the Peace Mediation Office in UAE-Finland Relations",

Brummer’s work in the President’s office complements this by providing high-level leadership and aligning the President’s diplomatic efforts with Finland’s overall mediation strategy. He works in close cooperation with the MFA’s Peace Mediation Centre and leverages partnerships with Finnish civil society experts, reflecting Finland’s approach of combining state and NGO strengths in peacemaking. Brummer helps integrate Finland’s mediation efforts into foreign policy initiatives, ensures consistent messaging in international fora, and supports the President in any mediation-related diplomacy, for example, President-led peace dialogues or support to UN initiatives. Overall, Brummer’s responsibilities bridge Finland’s long-standing vision of itself as a mediator with concrete action, advising on policy and directly participating in mediation efforts that advance Finland’s foreign policy goals of peace, stability, and multilateral conflict resolution. In public diplomatic forums, Brummer and Finnish representatives have framed the UAE as a valuable partner in peace efforts. In October 2024, Diplomatic Adviser to the UAE President Dr. Anwar Gargash met Brummer in Abu Dhabi and highlighted the strong relations between the UAE and Finland across various sectors. The Horn of Africa is a region where Finnish and UAE mediation interests intersect. Finland has a Special Envoy for Peace Mediation in the Horn of Africa (currently Suldaan Said Ahmed, a Somali-Finnish diplomat), indicating a focused effort on conflicts in Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan. The UAE likewise has been deeply involved in the Horn of Africa; brokering the Ethiopia/Eritrea peace in 2018, investing in Somalia’s development, and engaging in Sudan’s transition. Brummer works closely with Finland’s Horn of Africa envoy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate with regional and international partners."
  },
  {
    "title": "Bilateral Agreements & Diplomatic Engagements",
    "content": "Finland and the UAE have begun to build a direct dialogue on peace mediation and conflict resolution, especially since Brummer’s appointment. A key development was the establishment of a Political Consultation Committee between the two countries in 2022, intended to regularise discussions on bilateral and international issues. In its very first session (November 2022 in Abu Dhabi), this committee – co-chaired by Finland’s Under-Secretary of State Mr. Kai Sauer and UAE Minister Lana Nusseibeh – identified international peace and mediation as a shared interest for collaboration. Both sides agreed to explore concrete cooperation in this field, which set the stage for involving peace mediation experts like Brummer in subsequent meetings. Indeed, by 2024, Finland-UAE consultations moved from general principle to specific engagement. As mentioned in the previous section, in October 2024, Brummer travelled to Abu Dhabi and met with Dr. Anwar Gargash to advance bilateral ties in areas including diplomacy. Another layer of bilateral cooperation has been the exchange of best practices in mediation. In late 2024, the Finnish Embassy in Abu Dhabi, in partnership with the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy – the UAE’s premier diplomatic training institute – organised a panel discussion on the state of global mediation, featuring Ville Brummer and the Academy’s Director, Dr. Nickolay Mladenov. Both Finland and the UAE are active at the United Nations. Finland co-chairs the UN Group of Friends of Mediation and has spearheaded UN resolutions to strengthen mediation, while the UAE has served on the UN Security Council (2022–2023) where it has advocated for dialogue in conflicts. Finnish and Emirati diplomats have a history of consultation at the UN on peace initiatives."

Finland has expressed readiness to work with regional actors to stabilise Somalia/Somaliland, an area where the UAE has been involved as well. Finland is a strong proponent of inclusive mediation – bringing women and youth into peace processes – as well as innovative methods like digital peacemaking. The UAE, with its emphasis on empowering women (for example, through the UAE’s Gender Balance Council) and youth leadership, might consider partnering with Finland on these themes."

Traditionally, relations have been positive despite geographical distance, and in recent years there is increasing mutual interest in further developing cooperation, evidenced by growing commercial ties, high-level visits, and tourism exchanges. The MFA guides this momentum by setting strategic priorities and coordinating with other Finnish actors (like the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Business Finland) to engage the UAE. Given that the UAE is Finland’s largest trading partner in the Gulf region, economic diplomacy is a core focus. Valtonen’s ministry works to expand trade and investment links – for example, by supporting the 70+ Finnish companies in the UAE and encouraging Emirati investment in Finland. This involves close collaboration with Finland’s Embassy in Abu Dhabi, which provides on-ground support for businesses and facilitates connections."

Key Agreements: Finland and the UAE have an established legal framework over five decades that underpins their relationship: 1982: Agreement on Economic, Industrial and Technical Cooperation (first broad economic cooperation treaty); 1996: Two pivotal agreements were signed, one for the Avoidance of Double Taxation (to encourage investment by preventing dual taxation) and another for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, which have facilitated trade and investment flows; 2013: Air Services Agreement, enabling direct flights and air connectivity; 2016: Agreement on the Exchange of Information Relating to Tax Matters, enhancing transparency and cooperation in tax compliance; Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs): Numerous MoUs complement these treaties in sectors like education, defence cooperation, and innovation. Notably, in May 2022 an MoU was signed to develop technical and economic cooperation in the energy sector and promote market access, reflecting a joint push into renewables and energy security. To celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations (1975–2025), Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo visited the UAE, accompanied by a large business delegation, and the inauguration of Finland’s new Embassy premises in Abu Dhabi was held, opened together with UAE Minister of State H.E. Noura Al Kaabi. Bilateral engagement has also grown through specific initiatives. In May 2024, for example, Finland’s Nokia launched an Open Innovation Lab in Dubai to drive regional innovation in AI and machine learning for network automation. This initiative, supported by both governments, aligns with the UAE’s focus on becoming a tech and smart city hub and Finland’s strength in telecommunications. There have also been recent Finnish ministerial visits focusing on education and digital economy, and reciprocal visits by UAE ministers (such as the UAE’s Minister of Economy and Minister of State for AI visiting Finland in 2019)."

Lana Nusseibeh and Finland’s Under-Secretary of State Kai Sauer), which institutionalised regular consultations on bilateral and regional issues; in 2024, Finland and the UAE convened a Joint Committee to deepen cooperation, with the second round held in Helsinki on 22 November 2024 alongside a high-level UAE trade mission to Finland, co-chaired by the UAE’s Assistant Minister for Economic and Trade Affairs and Finland’s Deputy Minister for International Trade, during which both sides reaffirmed their commitment to expanding cooperation in fields including trade and investment, food and water security, education, digitalisation and AI, space, and transportation & logistics, and which led to the inauguration of the UAE–Finland Business Council; and in early 2025, Heikkinen herself headed a Finnish delegation to the UAE to boost collaboration in clean energy and innovation."

    "content": "The Ehrnrooth family is Finland’s most prominent noble business dynasty, with a 150-year legacy of shaping the nation’s economy. Originating as an aristocratic military family, they successfully expanded their economic and social capital into industry and finance during Finland’s modernization. The Ehrnrooths built a wide portfolio of industrial and financial assets, leveraging broad networks and a willingness to invest in emerging sectors. Ehrnrooth family members have held top leadership positions across banking, manufacturing, forestry, and technology. For example, Göran Ehrnrooth (1905–1996) was a leading banker, and his son Casimir Ehrnrooth became CEO of a major forest products firm (Kaukas/UPM) and later chaired Nokia’s board during the company’s global ascent. Another branch of the family oversaw Fiskars, the iconic consumer goods company – Göran J. Ehrnrooth served as Fiskars’ CEO. Through family investment vehicles (like Structor and Corbis S.A.), the Ehrnrooths have been anchor owners of companies such as YIT (construction) – with a ~12% holding and board chair role and Pöyry/AFRY (engineering) – owning about one-third of the firm. They also have ties to Wärtsilä (energy technology), where family patriarch Göran J. Ehrnrooth served as Vice Chairman. This breadth of influence makes them a significant behind-the-scenes player in Finland’s economic landscape, with a reputation for stable, long-term stewardship of major companies."

    "title": "UAE-Related Statements and Policies",
    "content": "Members of the Ehrnrooth family have increasingly aligned their business strategies with opportunities in the Middle East, including the UAE. While they rarely make overt political statements, their corporate actions and public comments reflect a recognition of the UAE’s importance as a growth market. For instance, under the leadership of Henrik Ehrnrooth as CEO, KONE Corporation highlighted the Gulf region’s booming demand for urban infrastructure. Industry reports noted that rising elevator and escalator needs in the Middle East were a key driver of market growth, a trend KONE actively capitalized on. In an interview, Henrik underscored how Middle Eastern mega-projects and rapid urbanisation contribute to the company’s global business, signaling the family’s positive outlook on the region’s development. On the policy front, the Ehrnrooth-led businesses have made strategic investments and local commitments in the UAE that align with Finland’s economic diplomacy goals. Jaakko Pöyry Group (now AFRY), chaired by Henrik Ehrnrooth, established a permanent office in Dubai back in 1996 – a forward-looking move to support the UAE’s energy and water projects."

    "title": "Role of Ehrnooth family in UAE-Finland Relations",
    "content": "The Ehrnrooths often participate in high-level business dialogues relevant to the UAE. Family-controlled firms are regularly part of Team Finland delegations and bilateral trade forums. Many of Finland’s top companies active in the UAE bear the Ehrnrooth imprint, thereby directly contributing to bilateral trade, investment flows, and even soft diplomacy. Energy and sustainable technology is another arena of collaboration where the Ehrnrooths have impact. Wärtsilä Corporation, where the family has long held board-level influence, has provided power solutions in the Emirates. Wärtsilä’s first UAE power plant project in Ras Al Khaimah brought high-efficiency gas engine generators to support local industry, a milestone in introducing Finnish clean-energy technology to the UAE. The family’s engineering consultancy, Pöyry/AFRY, has advised on Gulf infrastructure for decades, contributing know-how in power grids, water supply, and renewable energy integration. Finnish exports to the UAE (totaling €565 million in 2023) are dominated by products and services in which the Ehrnrooth family’s firms excel – e.g. machinery, engineering services, and pulp & paper. During a January 2025 visit by Finland’s Prime Minister, the delegation of 30 Finnish companies included KONE, Nokia, and Wärtsilä, indicating that Ehrnrooth-associated businesses are considered important to advancing the bilateral economic agenda."

The UAE is investing heavily in diversification – targeting sectors like advanced technology, renewable energy, smart infrastructure, and logistics – all areas where the Ehrnrooth-led companies have strengths. No major political obstacles or value conflicts divide the Ehrnrooth enterprises and UAE interests – their goals are largely complementary. Potential competitive friction could come from global rivals: for example, in telecommunications or elevators, the Finnish firms must compete with other international players also courting UAE contracts."

These partnerships are vital for consistent market presence and consumer recognition. • Participation in Expo 2020 Dubai: Fiskars products were showcased at Finland’s national pavilion, emphasizing Finnish design excellence, sustainability, and craftsmanship, further strengthening brand awareness among Emirati consumers, government officials, and international visitors. • Sustainability Forums and Events: Fiskars has engaged in UAE-hosted sustainability events, promoting Finnish best practices in sustainable product design, recyclability, and circular economy, which align strongly with UAE national strategies."

ISKU’s focus on learning environment innovation aligns with the UAE’s priority to upgrade education infrastructure in line with Vision 2030. However, the highly competitive UAE furniture and interiors market poses challenges. ISKU, as a premium Finnish brand, often faces competition from global brands and local suppliers that may offer lower prices or faster supply chains. Additionally, the physical distance between Finland and the UAE creates logistical challenges, including shipping delays and supply chain disruptions, as well as complexities in providing after-sales support. To mitigate these issues, strategies such as maintaining inventory buffers or utilising a Dubai showroom as a mini-warehouse are employed, though logistics and cost remain continuous concerns."

A prime example is the Team Finland trade delegation to the UAE in January 2025, which Business Finland assembled and Noponen oversaw. This delegation – timed with the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations – brought the Finnish Prime Minister and 30 leading Finnish companies to Abu Dhabi and Dubai for direct talks with Emirati officials and entrepreneurs. The program featured B2B meetings and networking with UAE public and private sectors, targeting collaborations in sustainability and digital economy areas. Such visits, coordinated by Business Finland, open doors for Finnish firms and signal Finland’s commitment at the highest level. Business Finland also actively pursues specific initiatives to facilitate cooperation. In late 2024, it launched a study of the UAE’s data economy ecosystem to map opportunities for Finnish tech companies in the Emirates. This project, part of Business Finland’s Digitalization programs, aims to identify key local players and inform Finnish businesses’ market entry strategies – exemplifying how Noponen’s team provides market intelligence to enable Finnish success in the UAE. Additionally, Business Finland supports the implementation of bilateral frameworks like the Finland–UAE Energy Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2022, which promotes Finnish clean-tech access to the Emirati energy market.

Finnish companies,from ICT firms to AI startups,see the UAE as an attractive market for cutting-edge solutions. The UAE’s emphasis on becoming a knowledge economy aligns with Finland’s education and R&D capabilities. The UAE’s status as a global business hub means Finnish companies operate in a very competitive arena. The Emirates are crowded with international suppliers and investors, from larger economies and closer neighbors, all vying for contracts in infrastructure, tech, or energy projects. Finnish firms – many of which are niche players or SMEs – must work to raise their profile and prove their value against strong global competitors. This sometimes requires additional marketing, local partnerships, or pilot projects to demonstrate capabilities. The Finnish government and Business Finland help by organising high-level visits and showcases (like the Expo 2020 Dubai pavilion and trade fairs) to boost visibility, but sustaining attention in the UAE market is an ongoing challenge."

    "content": "Antti Herlin is Finland’s most influential industrialist and one of the country’s wealthiest individuals, serving as Chairman of KONE Corporation, a global leader in elevators, escalators, and smart building solutions. As the great-grandson of KONE’s founder, he has played a crucial role in transforming the family-owned business into a multinational powerhouse, overseeing its expansion into emerging markets, including the UAE and wider Middle East. Under his leadership, KONE is now one of the top elevator companies globally, competing with Otis, Schindler, and Thyssenkrupp. Beyond KONE, Herlin has extensive influence in Finnish industry and finance, holding major stakes in companies like Cargotec (logistics & port automation) and Security Trading Oy (his investment firm). He is known for long-term strategic planning, quiet diplomacy, and business pragmatism—traits that make him a key figure in Finland’s economic diplomacy with the UAE and the Gulf."

His contributions include: Technology & Smart Cities: KONE’s work in Dubai Metro, Burj Khalifa, and the Expo site enhances Finland’s brand in sustainable infrastructure solutions; Trade & Investment Flows: KONE’s Middle East operations contribute to Finland’s export footprint, with UAE business valued in the hundreds of millions of euros annually; Business Diplomacy & Bilateral Ties: KONE’s deep engagement serves as a bridge for Finland-UAE business discussions, influencing trade delegations and investment forums."

    "content": "KONE’s investment in UAE operations strengthens Finland’s position in UAE trade negotiations, ensuring that Finnish firms have a strong foothold in regional infrastructure projects. KONE faces growing competition from Chinese firms (like Hitachi and Mitsubishi) offering lower-cost elevator solutions. KONE’s proprietary AI-driven maintenance systems may face regulatory scrutiny in UAE’s rapidly evolving AI laws."
